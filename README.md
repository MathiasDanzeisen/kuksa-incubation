This is a KUKSA repository for incubation components.
That is components that as of today is not intended for production purposes.
They could however be useful as design-base or for demo-purposes.

Some implications on that this is a repository for incubation components

* Vulnerability Management (Dependabot) is not enabled for this repository.
* Limited effort spent on artifacts like Bill-of-Material and Open Source Scanning
* Limited effort spent on testing before creating tags and releases

Incubation components may be promoted to "real components" in a separate repository if there
is a strong interest in the component and active maintainers/contributors willing to maintain the component.
